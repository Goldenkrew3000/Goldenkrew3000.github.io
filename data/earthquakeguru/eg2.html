						<u><h2>UI Fixes:</h2></u>
						Easter Eggs have been added (but can be disabled).<br>
						Bot now changes the activity so you can see how many servers this bot is on, how many people have access to this bot, and how to bring up the help message.<br>
						Bot changes its activity every 30 seconds to comply with discord regulations -- this number can be changed if any new regulations come in the future.<br>
						Cleaned up specifically the help section so it looks a lot better than 1.8a<br>

						<u><h2>Other Fixes:</h2></u>
						Added release mode so testing new features of the bot won't interrupt the actual bot.<br>
						Added settings in the form of variables in the program incase anything needs to change to comply with regulations or complaints.<br>
						Added lots of logging features to easily detect errors.<br>
						Added botColor variable with a hex code so every color throughout the bot can be consistent (This could also be considered a UI Fix).<br>
						Cleaned up the actual code pulling the data from the earthquake JSON.<br>
						Massively cleaned up the comments in the code.<br>

						<u><h2>Added Commands:</h2></u>
						e!changelog -- Brings you to this website for, well, the changelog.<br>
						e!stats -- Shows the CPU and RAM Statistics, as well as showing how many servers this bot is on and how many people have access to this bot (This also happens in the activity).<br>

						<u><h2>Future Changes:</h2></u>
						Fix the prefix error so it only responds with the prefix 'e!'.<br>
						Fix the console permission error everytime someone uses a command (if still present).<br>
						Replace the NPM package 'request' with something that isn't depreciated<br>
