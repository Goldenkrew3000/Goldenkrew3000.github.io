						<u><h2>UI Fixes:</h2></u>
						Easter Eggs have been added (but can be disabled).<br>
						Bot now changes the activity so you can see how many servers this bot is on, how many people have access to this bot, and how to bring up the help message.<br>
						Bot changes its activity every 30 seconds to comply with discord regulations -- this number can be changed if any new regulations come in the future.<br>
						Cleaned up specifically the help section so it looks a lot better than 1.8a<br>
						Fix the prefix error so it only responds with the prefix 'e!'.<br>

						<u><h2>Other Fixes:</h2></u>
						Added release mode so testing new features of the bot won't interrupt the actual bot.<br>
						Added settings in the form of variables in the program incase anything needs to change to comply with regulations or complaints.<br>
						Added lots of logging features to easily detect errors.<br>
						Added botColor variable with a hex code so every color throughout the bot can be consistent (This could also be considered a UI Fix).<br>
						Cleaned up the actual code pulling the data from the earthquake JSON.<br>
						Massively cleaned up the comments in the code.<br>

						<u><h2>Added Commands:</h2></u>
						e!changelog -- Brings you to this website for, well, the changelog.<br>
						e!stats -- Shows the CPU and RAM Statistics, as well as showing how many servers this bot is on and how many people have access to this bot (This also happens in the activity).<br>

						<u><h2>Future Changes:</h2></u>
						<font color="red">
							<u><h3>RED = Havent Started working on it</h3></u>
							Fix the console permission error that appears every so often (First there needs to be some investigation into this because I don't know why it happens yet.<br>
							Add uptime command (e!uptime) to show server and bot uptime.<br>
							Change the stats (e!stats) command so the command only uses one MessageEmbed/Look better.<br>
							Remove decimals from the RAM part of the stats command (e!stats).<br>
							Fix the stats (e!stats) command so it doesnt use shell commands to please our lord and saviour Michael Reeves :3.<br>
							Add check to see if number on e!recent custom number.<br>
							For command (e!recent custom 2) change the top right counter to out of that custom number instead of the total amount of earthquakes.
						</font>
						<br>
						<font color="yellow">
							<u><h3>YELLOW = Working on it</h3></u>
							Final rewrite to clean up everything and 'polish' the discord bot ready for release.
						</font>
						<br>
						<font color="lime">
							<u><h3>GREEN = Finished working on it</h3></u>
							Added a settable interval to the discord activity changer.<br>
							Find an NPM Package that is good enough to replace 'request' (I think this is needed for bot verification).<br>
							Remove the easter eggs because the bot probably cant become verified like that.<br>
							<sub>1</sub>Add function to convert seconds into a more readable format for the future.<br>
							<sub>1</sub>Add function to convert milliseconds to seconds for the future.<br>
							<sub>1</sub>Add function to convert seconds to minutes for the future.<br>
							<sub>1</sub>Add function to convert seconds to hours for the future.<br>
							<sub>1</sub>Add function to convert seconds to days for the future.<br>
							<sub>2</sub>Add function to remove decimals from a variable.
						</font><br><br>

						(1) - Did not add a function, but is implemented separately.<br>
						(2) - Math.floor() in native javascript does this.<br>

						<u><h2>Future Changes that affect the bot but arent the bot:</h2></u>
						<font color="red">
							Make a support server for this bot.<br>
						</font>
						<font color="lime">
							Fix the top.gg listing to be more informative now that this bot is a thing.<br>
						</font>

						<u><h2>Stuff to be added or changed in later versions:</h2></u>
						<font color="gray">
							Sometime in the future add a way to get donations if anyone would ever want to do that for some reason.<br>
						</font>

						<u><h2>Predicted Release Date for EarthquakeGuru 2.1: Sometime in 2021!<h2><u>
